<!-- template-end -->

A Plugin implementing simple _Sign_ based warps.

Basic Usage:

Place a Sign with the following text:

	[SWARP]
	x y z

Where `x`, `y` and `z` are numbers containing the target warp
coordinates.

Or for a warp between worlds:

	[WORLD]
	world_name
	x y z

Where `world_name` is the world to warp to, and *optionally* the
`x`, `y` and `z` warp location.

For Warp between servers use:

	[TRANSFER]
	server-address
	port

You need the **FastTransfer** plugin for this to work.

## Documentation

This plugin implements _warps_ through the placement of _signs_.  You
need to create a sign with the text:

	[SWARP]
	x y z

`x`, `y` and `z` are integers containing the target coordinates for
this warp.

To activate a _warp_ the player must touch a sign.  That will teleport
the player to the new location described by the `x`, `y`, `z`
coordinates.

The third and four lines of the sign are ignored and can be used to
describe the _warp_.

To teleport between worlds, the sign text should look like:

	[WORLD]
	world_name
	x y z
	Players:

`world_name` is the target world to teleport to.  `x`, `y`, `z` is the
target location.  If not specified it defaults to the `spawn` world.

If dynamic updates are enabled, the fourth line can contain the text
`Players:`, which will get updated dynamically with the number of
players on that world.  Otherwise the ine is  ignored and can
contain any descriptive text.

To help identify potential _warp_ targets, the command `xyz` is
provided.  Entering `/xyz` in-game will display the current
coordinates of the player.

For Warp between servers use:

	[TRANSFER]
	server-address
	port

The `port` is optional, and would default to `19132` (the default for
Minecraft PE servers).  If you do not need to specify a port, then you
can add some descriptive text instead.  The last line is ignored and
can be used for description.

You need the **FastTransfer** plugin for this to work.
